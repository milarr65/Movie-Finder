# Movie Finder || Web-dev Project

This project is a fully functional movie hub where users can search for detailed information about movies and tv shows. It can handle search queries and it's organized based on popularity. (Not compatible for mobile devices)

Details, pictures and videos are provided by [The Movie Database API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started)

<strong>All the code was written by me, no tutorial was used for the development of this website.</strong>

### About

This project is an assignment from online course **_"The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp"_**
The goal was to use an api of our choosing and build a website based on that. We were given full control over the code and appearance of it.

Built with NodeJS and Node Express.
